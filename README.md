# k_os

Operating system built in Rust ⚡️

## About

A robust x86_64 operating system, incorporating key features such as memory management, multitasking, and dynamic memory allocation.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by and based on the work of phil-opp/blog_os. I would like to express my gratitude to phil-opp for their exceptional efforts in creating such a comprehensive resource. I am actively following along with their blog to enhance my understanding and skills in systems programming.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build upon the foundation provided by blog_os and develop additional features. By leveraging the knowledge gained from following the blog, I aim to expand upon the existing functionality and contribute my unique ideas to the project. Through this process, I hope to deepen my understanding of operating systems and refine my programming abilities.
